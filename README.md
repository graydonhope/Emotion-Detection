# Emotion-Detection
Uses OpenCV and your front-facing camera to detect your emotion based on facial features. By accessing your live camera or webcam data, this model can detect some common emotions and send back a classification for live interaction. 

### Some examples
#### Here are some examples with different backgrounds and lighting.

#### Model can still classify with some disturbance (eg. your annoying cat trying to jump into your photos)

## Features
  • If you are smiling and you say 'Cheese!' the camera will snap and save a picture. This is a hands-free approach to getting high-quality and happy selfies.

  • Live feed classification. This model accesses the camera using OpenCV so it can classify emotions very quickly and return the results to the screen.
  
  • Still functional with different lighting and noise in picture (ex with cat or glasses on)

#### Please note only the model is uploaded at this time. There are other supporting files used to interact with the camera and data which I am keeping private at this time.
